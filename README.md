For this program to run you need the following programs:
- **datasets/**: Contains the poetry form descriptions and pronunciation dictionaries.
- **sample_poems/**: Example poems for testing the program. (Just in case it does not work)
- **poetry_constants.py**: Defines custom data types and constants used throughout the project.
- I  have linked my sample in the repository but you can use yours
